# TimeTop

# A pure Windows SDK app that helps the user track time on presentations.
Does not rely on third-party components / dependencies.

# Main features:
- lets the user set a timeout in minutes (ex. 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, custom).
- lets de user start the countdown from the current timestamp
- when running, it displays a discrete semi-transparent progress bar on the top of the screen, with size relative to the remaining time (from left to right)
- the progress bar always appears on top of all other windows
- when the mouse hovers the progress bar, a quick tool tip appears with the remaining time.
- when the user right-clicks the progress bar, a context menu appears (settings, about, exit).
- the settings window allows the user to configure the timeout, and choose the progress bar color and thickness.
- when the app starts, it assumes a 30 minute countdown and immediately starts the progress bar.
- the app does not include any other typical app windows
